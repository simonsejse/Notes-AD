# About
These notes are my notes for the course Algorithms and Data Structures at DIKU. The notes are based on the lectures and the book Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al. The notes are not complete and may contain errors. If you find any errors, please let me know by DM'ing me or creating a Pull Request on GitHub.

If you like the LaTeX document and wish to use the updated version it is my LaTeX template hosted on my GitHub: https://github.com/simonsejse/latex-template
# Preview
I use CI/CD to build the Latex document and upload it to the directory, such that, each push always ensures a new updated root.pdf file.
