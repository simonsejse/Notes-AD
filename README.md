# About
These notes are my notes for the course Algorithms and Data Structures at DIKU. The notes are based on the lectures and the book Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al. The notes are not complete and may contain errors. If you find any errors, please let me know by DM'ing me or creating a Pull Request on GitHub.

The LaTeX used is my own at my GitHub: https://github.com/simonsejse/latex-template
# Preview
I use CI/CD to build the Latex document and upload it to the directory, such that, each push will ensure a new updated root.pdf file.
